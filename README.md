# TBGranuloma
This repository contains scripts for Pyle et al. 2025 mBio, including spatial snRNA-seq and scRNA-seq from human and a bulk RNA-seq from zebrafish.

Pyle et al. (2025) Paired single-cell and spatial transcriptional profiling reveals a central osteopontin macrophage response mediating tuberculous granuloma formation in humans and zebrafish. _mBio_, e01559-25

The scRNA-seq data is also available at Broad Single Cell Portal: https://singlecell.broadinstitute.org/single_cell/study/SCP3268/paired-single-cell-and-spatial-transcriptional-profiling-reveals-a-central-osteopontin-macrophage-response-mediating-tuberculous-granuloma-formation.
