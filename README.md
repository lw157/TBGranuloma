# TBGranuloma
This repository contains scripts for Pyle et al. 2025 mBio, including spatial snRNA-seq and scRNA-seq from human and a bulk RNA-seq from zebrafish.

Reference:

Pyle CJ, Wang L, Beerman RW, Jain V, Ohman HK, Thompson BA, Abramson KR, Ko DC, Gregory SG, Smith CM, Neff JL. Paired single-cell and spatial transcriptional profiling reveals a central osteopontin macrophage response mediating tuberculous granuloma formation. _mBio_ (2025):e01559-25.

The scRNA-seq data is also available at Broad Single Cell Portal: https://singlecell.broadinstitute.org/single_cell/study/SCP3268/paired-single-cell-and-spatial-transcriptional-profiling-reveals-a-central-osteopontin-macrophage-response-mediating-tuberculous-granuloma-formation.
